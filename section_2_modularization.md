## 2. Code Modularization into Multiple Modules/Crates

Separating the tensor engine into logical components improves maintainability and allows for flexible activation or deactivation of features (e.g., accelerated backends). It's recommended to structure the code into several interrelated modules or even separate crates:

### 2.1. Generic Core (`Tensor<T>`)
Define the base tensor structure (e.g., with fields for `Vec<T>` data and dimensions) in a central module. This part should be independent of specific numerical details, allowing `T` to be a generic type parameter (e.g., numeric types, complex numbers, or even symbolic types).
*   **Technical Term**: A "generic core" refers to designing the main `Tensor` struct with a generic type parameter `T` (e.g., `struct Tensor<T> { data: Vec<T>, shape: Vec<usize> }`). This allows the tensor to hold various data types without the core logic needing to know the specifics of those types.
*   This core module should include common functions such as constructors, getters, shape manipulation functionality (reshape, expand, transpose), basic iteration, etc. Keeping this module free from heavy, specific operations facilitates its reuse.
*   **Example**: The `Candle` framework serves as an example, which separates a `candle-core` crate containing fundamental structures, while other crates add advanced features. This separation helps maintain a lean and focused core.

### 2.2. Numerical Specializations
Create modules or use "feature flags" to implement functions that are only valid for certain numeric types. For example, mathematical operations (like sine, logarithm) or inner products might require that `T` implements a trait like `Float` (a trait indicating a floating-point number).
*   **Technical Term**: "Numerical specializations" involve implementing functions or methods that are specific to numeric types (e.g., `f32`, `f64`, `i32`). This is often achieved by adding trait bounds to generic functions (e.g., `impl<T: num_traits::Float> Tensor<T> { fn sin(&self) -> Tensor<T> { ... } }`).
*   You could define an internal trait, say `TensorNumeric`, that extends Rust's existing bounds (like `Float`, `Add`, etc.), and then implement methods for `Tensor<T>` where `T` satisfies these bounds.
*   If Rust's "specialization" feature (an advanced feature allowing different implementations of a trait method based on concrete types) stabilizes in the future, it would allow the compiler to choose optimized implementations based on the type. For now, traits or macros can be used as alternatives.

### 2.3. Mathematical Operations and Operator Overloading
Organize operations into separate modules. For instance:
*   An `ops` module could implement traits from `std::ops` (like `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, etc.) for the `Tensor` type.
    *   **Technical Term**: "Operator overloading" allows standard operators like `+`, `-`, `*` to be used with custom types (like your `Tensor`). This is achieved by implementing the corresponding traits from the `std::ops` module (e.g., `impl<T> std::ops::Add for Tensor<T> { ... }`).
*   Each operator implementation can handle broadcasting logic (how operations between tensors of different shapes are performed) or verify shapes before operating.
*   Similarly, a `linalg` (linear algebra) module could contain algorithms like matrix multiplication, BLAS routines, convolutions, etc., potentially delegating these to external backends. Keeping these calculations separate from the core makes the code more modular.

### 2.4. Accelerated Functions (SIMD/BLAS Backends)
You can have a `simd` or `fast` module that includes backend-specific implementations.
*   For example, a function `fast::add_f32(x: &mut [f32], y: &[f32])` might internally use SIMD intrinsics (low-level CPU instructions, e.g., `unsafe { core::arch::x86_64::_mm256_loadu_ps(...) }`) to sum two `f32` buffers using AVX2 instructions.
*   These low-level functions can be placed behind a "feature flag" (e.g., `"simd_accel"`).
    *   **Technical Term**: "Feature flags" are conditional compilation options defined in a crate's `Cargo.toml` file. They allow users of the crate to enable or disable certain parts of the code (like SIMD optimizations or specific backend integrations). This can reduce compile times and binary size if those features aren't needed.
*   This way, they are only compiled when maximum performance on compatible CPUs is desired. Similarly, you could have a `blas` module to call routines from OpenBLAS, MKL (Intel Math Kernel Library), or `matrixmultiply` (a pure Rust alternative) for large matrix multiplications. This modular design allows users of your crate to activate only the necessary components.

### 2.5. Error Handling
Define a dedicated module (or file, e.g., `error.rs`) for your custom error structures (e.g., a `TensorError` enum with variants like `ShapeMismatch`, `OutOfBounds`, `TypeMismatch`, etc.).
*   Implement `std::error::Error` and `std::fmt::Display` for these custom error types to integrate them idiomatically with Rust's error handling ecosystem.
*   Internally, tensor functions should use `Result<..., TensorError>` to propagate failures rather than using `panic!` (which causes the program to crash), except perhaps in critical low-level cases where recovery is impossible. This facilitates testing and allows for safe handling of exceptional conditions (e.g., invalid dimensions, division by zero).
*   **Crate Purpose**: Using crates like `thiserror` can simplify the definition of custom error types.
    *   **`thiserror`**: This crate provides a derive macro (`#[derive(Error)]`) that significantly reduces the boilerplate code needed to create well-behaved custom error types. It automatically implements `std::error::Error` and helps with `std::fmt::Display`.

### 2.6. Main Crate and Sub-crates (Workspaces)
If the project grows significantly, consider dividing it into multiple crates within a Cargo "workspace."
*   **Technical Term**: A "workspace" in Cargo is a feature that allows managing multiple related crates as a single project. This is useful for large projects where different components can be developed and compiled somewhat independently but are still linked together.
*   For example:
    *   A `tensor-core` crate with the generic core and base API.
    *   A `tensor-numeric` crate that depends on `core` and provides optimized numeric implementations.
    *   Perhaps a `tensor-derive` crate with helper macros.
*   This structure allows other projects to use only the generic core if they require it, or to replace specific components.
*   **Example**: The `Candle` deep learning framework is a real-world example; it consists of several crates (`candle-core`, `candle-nn`, `candle-vision`, etc.), decoupling the basic data structure from higher-level neural network implementations.
*   **Example**: Similarly, `RSTSR` (a Rust tensor library) mentions that its functionality can be extended with other modular crates, following this composable design approach.

This modularization makes the code cleaner and facilitates collaboration (e.g., someone could implement an external `tensor-wgpu` crate for future GPU support, integrating with your core crate). It can also reduce compilation times, as changes in one module do not necessarily require recompiling the entire project.
